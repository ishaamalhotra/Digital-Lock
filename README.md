# Digital-Lock
Project Overview:
The Digital Lock System is a security access system based on an Arduino-controlled keypad authentication mechanism. Users must enter a predefined 4-digit password using a 3x4 keypad to unlock a servo-driven mechanism, simulating a door lock. The system provides real-time feedback on a 16x2 LCD display, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
